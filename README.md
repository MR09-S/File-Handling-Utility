**INTERN ID:** CT08UFC
**DOMAIN:** JAVA  
**DURATION:** 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR:** NEELA SANTOSH  

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a Java-based File Handling Utility that demonstrates essential file operations, including writing, reading, and modifying (appending) text files. This utility provides an interactive menu-driven interface that allows users to choose different file operations conveniently.

File handling is a fundamental concept in Java that enables programs to interact with external files for data storage, retrieval, and modification. It is widely used in real-world applications such as logging, configuration management, report generation, and database integration.

## Requirements
The program should implement the following functionalities:

### 1. Write to a File
- Users should be able to enter text, which gets stored in a file.  
- If the file already exists, its content should be overwritten with the new input.  
- Use `FileWriter` and `BufferedWriter` to handle the writing operation efficiently.  

### 2. Read from a File
- The program should allow users to read and display the contents of a specified file.  
- If the file does not exist, an appropriate error message should be displayed.  
- Use `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` to read the file efficiently line by line.  

### 3. Modify (Append) a File
- Users should be able to add new content to an existing file without deleting its previous data.  
- The program should append the new input to the file instead of overwriting it.  
- Use `FileWriter` in append mode (`true`) to ensure existing content remains unchanged.  

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- The program should provide a menu-driven system that allows users to navigate between different file operations easily.  
- Error handling should be implemented to manage cases like missing files, incorrect input, and I/O exceptions.  

## Expected Deliverables
To successfully complete this task, the following deliverables should be submitted:

✔ A functional Java program implementing file handling operations.  
✔ Proper documentation and comments in the code to improve readability.  
✔ A GitHub repository containing the complete source code.  
✔ A well-structured README file that explains the program’s functionality, installation, and usage.  

## Technical Implementation
The program utilizes Java’s built-in `java.io` package, which provides various classes for handling files efficiently:

- **`FileWriter`** – Writes characters to a file.  
- **`BufferedWriter`** – Improves performance by buffering file write operations.  
- **`FileReader`** – Reads characters from a file.  
- **`BufferedReader`** – Reads text from a file efficiently, line by line.  

Additionally, exception handling using `try-with-resources` ensures proper resource management and prevents memory leaks.
